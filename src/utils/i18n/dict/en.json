By learning to program, I found it very rewarding to create something from nothing. Also, it is one of my great interests to keep learning and exploring new technologies. I like to learn about the latest technology and development trends and try to apply them to my projects. I also love finding and sharing knowledge about technology on development platforms like Stack Overflow, Github, etc. I hope to become a full-stack developer and provide users with excellent web applications while constantly learning and exploring innovative technologies."
